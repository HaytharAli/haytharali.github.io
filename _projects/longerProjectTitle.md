###WINNER OF UNITY'S CHOICE FOR BEST USE OF GAME ENGINE AT GAMECON 2023

###NOMINEE FOR BEST 3RD YEAR GAME AT GAMECON 2023

Debtlocked Dual was the third year project game from my team Infinite Monkey Theorem. In this party game, players must play through a variety of minigames created from a combination of two mechanics. Between Falling Platforms, Dodgeballs, Flying Robot Bumpers and more, there are tonnes of possible combinations to experience!

##My Role
On this project, I worked as the lead designer and project manager. I was responsible figuring out how each of these mechanics could be extended to find interesting interactions, and the interesting contexts of them put together. I programmed most of these mechanics, and worked along another designer to build the levels worked to showcase how these mechanics worked well together. With the fast pace and limited time of development for this school project, I was often forced to rethink my mechanics due to technical constraints and issues. When something wasn't working, I would go back to the drawing board and find new ways to achieve a similar effect, and often it was even more interesting than the initial idea.

In addition to the above roles, I also worked as a technical artist on this project, creating the tune shader and post processed outline shader using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline, as a networking engineer, helping build elements of the fully custom networking solution, and did a small amount of modeling.

This was a difficult project, as this was our first time working on a large and long term Unity project. However, the lesson's learned were valuable and I'm very happy with what we managed to create.
