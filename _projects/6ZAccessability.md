title: Accessibility in Virtual Spaces (OCAD University)
description: Responsible for creating a system that allowed the blind to traverse virtual spaces
---

I was responsible for creating a system that developers could implement in their virtual environments to help make their virtual spaces accessible. With the pandemic, more and more parts of our daily lives went virtual. With the concept of the metaverse growing, we needed to ensure that accessibility was not forgotten.

In a team, I was responsible for designing and programming an interface that helped the visually disabled know what was around them and helped them navigated. This system was flexible, and could be used to navigate 2D user interfaces like Zoom, or 3D environments like VR Chat. It could be interacted with using a touch screen, controller, keyboard, or even a VR headset and controller or handtracking.

Unfortunately, the project is ongoing, and none of the results are publically available.
