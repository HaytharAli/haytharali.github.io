Built for Global Game Jam 2023. Inspired by A Crack in the Slab from Dishonored 2 and Effect and Cause from Titanfall 2, this game was an opportunity to test stealth mechanics for an upcoming project. Due to technical issues from the venue and a personal situation, the game was not completed to the standard I was aiming for, but we published it all the same!

On this project, I was the level designer, my first chance in a singleplayer game. I also programmed the character and the timeline swap mechanic.
