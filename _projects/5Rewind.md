Rewinders was an arena shooter where you fought enemies in the past and the future. Players would go head to head in a twin stick shooter, and their actions recorded. The next round, they would spawn in a different place and face off again, except a recording of the previous round is also occuring simulatneously. This allowed players to fight enemies who have not yet spawned as they will play in future rounds.

I was the lead designer and programmer on this project, and built the time rewind mechanic. Unfortunately a team member dropped out of the project late and we were not able to get a player controller ready for the game in time, leaving it unfinished.
